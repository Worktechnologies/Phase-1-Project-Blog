Designing of the buttons was really easy to fit them in the row By using HTML and CSS.I tried to get some help by using some search engines to make<br>
                         the buttons to work in their own way and it went well. can do simple calculation (Addition(+),Substraction(-),Multipication(*) as shown in the calculator
                    <br>it can be a good idea to have some knowledge about html,css,js,read some articles and go through lots of websites to get an idea and help before starting the project.  </p>
